We already know how to _read_ and _create_ data, let's `UPDATE` some data!

In this unit, we will learn how to _modify_ some of our database tables data as well as the table definition itself.

By the end of this unit you will:

- Understand how to `UPDATE` existing data sets
- `ALTER` existing table column datatype definitions
- `ALTER` table names
- `ADD` columns to an existing table
- Change database names

Are you ready? 

Let's continue.
