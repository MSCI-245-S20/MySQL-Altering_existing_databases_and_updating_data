If you followed along with the previous unit, you must remember some of the SQL data types. 

This time, we present the use of the `FLOAT(size,d)` and the `DATETIME` data types. 

From the official MySQL documentation: 

### The `FLOAT` MySQL data type: 

The `Float(size, d)` data type represents a small number with a floating decimal point.

The maximum number of digits may be specified in the `size` parameter. 

The maximum number of digits to the right of the decimal point is specified in the `d` parameter.

### The `DATETIME` MySQL data type:

A date and time combination. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS`.

__Note__: The supported range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'

Let's understand why we set these data types to our `trips` table in the next section.
