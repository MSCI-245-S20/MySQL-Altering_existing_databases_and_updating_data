In the previous unit, we associated the _**C**reate_ and _**R**ead_ words of the _CRUD_ acronym with the `INSERT` and `SELECT` SQL keywords.

Before inserting data into a database, there are a few things we need to make sure we have first:

1. A database
2. A database table definition

### Creating databases

By applying the `CREATE DATABASE name;` SQL statement, we were able to _open a space_ in the computer's memory for data to be stored in it. 

We learned that databases are sometimes called schemas and that the `CREATE SCHEMA name;` alternate syntax may work as well.

### Creating tables

Table definition is a little bit more complex in the way that we need to define the __table datatypes and constraints__.

The _PRIMARY KEY_ and the _NOT NULL_ constraints resulted useful as we improve the functionality and reliability of our database tables.

### Inserting data

Finally, the `INSERT` keyword allows us to _create_ data in the database table by specifying the order and actual data that is meant to live inside the table rows.
