We've learned how to _update_ the values of specific table columns and rows, but what about updating a table's name, a table column's name or its data types? 

### Presenting the `ALTER TABLE` statement:

The `ALTER TABLE` SQL statement can perform 3 basic types of operations:

- `ADD`
Adds columns together with its data types to an existing table
- `CHANGE`
Updates the name of an existing table column as well as its data type definition
- `DROP`
Deletes or removes columns (and their data)

In this unit, we will focus on the first two of them: `ADD` and `CHANGE`.
