For the means of exemplifying how the `UPDATE` SQL statement works, we wrote the `trip_datetime_end` and `trip_total_fare` values manually. 

However in a real world scenario, it is more probable that youâ€™d be using some programming language such as PHP, JavaScript, Java, Swift or Python to name a few, that would interact with a SQL database management system (like MySQL) and generate the `DATETIME` values automatically as well as calculating the total fares.
